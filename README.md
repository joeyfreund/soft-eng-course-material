Introduction To Software Engineering
====================================

This repo contains an archive of a 3rd year software engineering course, designed and taught by [Joey Freund](https://github.com/joeyfreund), at the University of Toronto.

The goal of the course is to give university students a glimps into the world of practical software engineering.
In this course, we discussed 4 different topics/issues.

In addition to the lectures and tutorials, we had the pleasure of having two guest lectures:
 * _Xavier Snelgrove_ from [Whirlscape](http://minuum.com/) talked about his experience founding and growing a startup, and competing in a high-visibility consumer space.
 * _Nahim Nasser_ & _Mark Reale_ from [BNotion](http://bnotions.com/) talked about their journey, starting as "a bunch of friends in a garage" and becoming one of Toronto's leading software shops.

### Course Work

 * A short [programming exercise](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Exercise1) (see [solution](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Exercise1Solution)), to be done in teams.     
   The goal of the exercise was to give students a chance to:
   * Brush up their programming skills (Java and basic Object-Oriented concepts in particular).
   * Work in a team.
   * Get used to using GitHub.
 * An 8-week long [project](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/ProjectOptions.md).     
   * The project was delivered in 4 phases (handout [1](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/Phase1Handout.md), [2](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/Phase2Handout.md), [3](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/Phase3Handout.md) and [4](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/Phase4Handout.md)) that focused on different aspects of software engineering.
   * See [this repo](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo) for as an example of a final project.
